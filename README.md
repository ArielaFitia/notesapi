# Simple REST API for Notes

A lightweight REST API built with Spring Boot for managing notes. This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations with a clean architecture and best practices in Java.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with a title and content.
- **Read Notes**: Retrieve all notes or a specific note by ID.
- **Update Notes**: Modify the title or content of an existing note.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove a note by its ID.
- **Validation**: Ensures that notes have valid input fields (non-empty title and content).

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Spring Data JPA** (with H2 Database for development)
- **Lombok** (for boilerplate code reduction)
